## 1) The first major point I want to make

Some code in a code block:

```

```

Some other code:

`<script>console.log('this is some injected code, not cool')</script>`

![an image of a light bulb](/uploads/bulb.png "An image I put in the middle of my post")

Then, I write some more. I like writing. As is clearly obvious from the fact that I never write anything anymore.
