      Curtis is our resident geek. He loves writing code and building great
      things on the internet. When he's not pounding away at the keys, he loves
      reading (particularly history), travel, and hanging out with his family.
      Born in Canada, he now lives in Scotland, where he can often be found
      tramping around ruined castles and eating haggis.
