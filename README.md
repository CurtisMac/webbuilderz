## **Start developing**

Navigate into the main directory and start it up:

    gatsby develop

This will serve a preview of the site

## **GraphQL**

`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`

This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql).

## **Netlify CMS**
Data for the site is edited in netlify CMS. Open https://webbuilderz.io/admin in a browser and login with github.
Once saved, changes will be updated to github and can be pulled into the code base with 

    git pull

To make changes to the CMS, edit static/admin/config.yml
